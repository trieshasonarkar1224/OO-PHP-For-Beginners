Object-oriented PHP for beginners: learn how to create classes, objects, and use methods to build applications. Covers procedural vs. object-oriented PHP, constructors, visibility modifiers, getters, and setters.


Highlights:
ðŸŒŸ This video script is a crash course in object-oriented PHP for beginners, focusing on explaining not just how to program object-oriented PHP but also why it's important to use it instead of procedural PHP.
          -Introduction to object-oriented PHP and the importance of understanding the 'why' behind using it, not just the 'how'.
          -Creating classes, objects, and functions in PHP, transitioning from procedural to object-oriented programming.
          -Explaining the concept of classes as templates or blueprints for creating objects, using a real-life example of a car factory.
ðŸŒŸ Creating classes in PHP involves defining properties and methods. Properties are like variables, holding object-specific information, while methods are functions for object actions.
          -Visibility modifiers in PHP classes control access to properties and methods, ensuring encapsulation and code security.
          -Understanding private, protected, and public visibility levels helps in managing data access within classes and their child classes.
          -Encouraging the use of private by default and selectively making data public or protected enhances code security and data encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
ðŸŒŸ A constructor in PHP is a method inside a class that runs when an object is created, allowing data assignment to properties. This ensures customization of object properties upon creation.
          -The importance of constructors in PHP for initializing object properties and running specific code upon object creation.
          -Distinguishing between placeholders and actual data in object creation and method parameters to customize object properties.
ðŸŒŸ Creating objects in a class involves defining properties and methods, assigning data using a Constructor, and accessing them through object instances. Objects allow interaction with class elements like properties and methods, enhancing code reusability and organization.
          -Assigning data to properties using a Constructor ensures objects have initial values, preventing errors when creating instances.
          -Setting properties to public allows external access, demonstrating how objects can interact with class elements.
          -Creating methods within a class enables additional functionality, utilizing class properties for operations.
ðŸŒŸ Accessing properties and methods within a class involves setting them as private and using public methods for access. It is best practice to use getter and setter methods to modify properties.
          -Explaining how to access properties within a class by setting them as private and using public methods for access.
          -Demonstrating the use of getter and setter methods to modify properties within a class.
ðŸŒŸ Using getter and setter methods in PHP allows for controlled access to class properties, enhancing code organization and customization, despite being slightly more complex and performance-heavy.
          -Creating getter and setter methods for class properties like brand and color provides a structured approach to modifying object attributes in PHP programming.
          -Utilizing getter and setter methods enables implementing custom logic for property access, such as restricting color options or validating input values, enhancing code flexibility and security.
ðŸŒŸ Using getter and setup methods in classes allows for controlled access to properties, enhancing code organization and security. Understanding the basics of classes and objects is essential for object-oriented PHP development.
          -Creating a database handler class with properties for database connection details and a method to establish a PDO connection for data manipulation.
          -Explaining the importance of encapsulation by setting sensitive methods as protected to restrict access and prevent unintended modifications, ensuring code integrity.
ðŸŒŸ  setting up a basic PHP form, connecting to a database, and creating a child class to access methods from a parent class. It emphasizes the importance of order in including classes.
          -Setting up a basic PHP form and including a method for data submission.
          -Connecting to a database by requiring database and signup files in a specific order.
          -Creating a child class to access protected methods from a parent class for database connection.
ðŸŒŸ  creating private functions and methods in PHP to interact with a database, emphasizing the importance of using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
          -Demonstrates connecting to a database using prepared statements and avoiding SQL injection. It highlights the use of parent:: to access methods from a parent class.
          -Explains the need for error handling and separate methods for different functionalities in a class. It shows how to check for empty inputs and handle errors.
          -Illustrates creating a method for error handling and guiding the user based on error messages. It concludes with signing up the user if no errors are encountered.
ðŸŒŸ Using classes instead of variables and functions in a procedural way can create a basic signup system. Making methods private or public based on usage outside the class is crucial for functionality and error handling.
          -Importance of setting methods as private or public based on usage outside the class for functionality and error handling. 
          -Creating a basic signup system by using classes instead of variables and functions in a procedural way.
          -The significance of having getter and setter methods for attributes like username and password in a class.
